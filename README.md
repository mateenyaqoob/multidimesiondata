# IoT Sensor Data Anomaly Detection

This notebook focuses on generating, analyzing, and modeling synthetic IoT sensor data for anomaly detection. The process includes:

Data Generation: Creating a synthetic dataset with various sensor readings (Temperature, Wind, Precipitation, Humidity, Pressure, Vibration) and an 'Anomaly' label based on specific conditions.
Data Exploration and Visualization: Analyzing the generated data through visualizations like histograms, correlation matrices, and pair plots to understand feature distributions and relationships with the anomaly label.
Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
Model Training: Training different machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Network) for anomaly detection.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applying PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize the results.
This notebook serves as a practical example of an end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection on sensor data, from data generation to model evaluation and visualization.



This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection on synthetic IoT sensor data. The notebook covers data generation, exploration, visualization, model training (using Random Forest, SVM, and CNN), evaluation, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
